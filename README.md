# ADHD_detection
This project aims to classify ADHD using ECG signals with a deep learning model. The main approach uses a 1D-CNN for feature extraction, and an additional Score-CAM method is used to extract high-dimensional features from the CNN for further training with traditional machine learning classifiers.
